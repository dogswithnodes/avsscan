{"name":"Automata Multi-Prover AVS","website":"https://ata.network","description":"Automata Network explores the development of TEE Coprocessors in the direction of a Multi-Prover AVS on EigenLayer. Decentralized systems bootstrap a secondary TEE Prover to minimize network-breaking bugs and achieve better security and decentralization. The approach is augmented by the introduction of TEE Committees, with the Multi-Prover AVS dually bounded by machine trust and cryptoeconomic security.","logo":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automata-network/multi-prover-avs-metadata/main/ata-logo.png","twitter":"https://twitter.com/automatanetwork"}
